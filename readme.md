# OS Dev


## Overview
This is a personal operating system project named `Eradicate`. The goal of this project is to learn about operating system development, including bootloaders, kernels, and low-level programming.

## Project structure

- `bin/`: Contains the compiled binary files.
- `isodir/`: Contains files needed to create an ISO image for booting.
- `src/`: Contains the source code files for the operating system.
- `my.py`: A Python script related to the project.
- `myos.iso`: The ISO image of the operating system.
- `setup.sh`: A shell script for setting up the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A Unix-based operating system (Linux, macOS).
- Git for version control.
- A compatible compiler (e.g., GCC) for building the project.
- Additional tools as needed for building the bootable ISO.

### Installation
- Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/syncrain/os_dev.git
   cd os_dev
   Build the project: use chmod +x setup.sh followed by ./setup.sh

## To-Do
- [ ] Implement a basic file system.
- [ ] Add keyboard input support.
- [ ] Develop a simple user interface.
- [ ] Optimize kernel performance.
- [ ] Write additional documentation.
